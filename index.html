            <p>“If you don't pay appropriate attention to what has your attention, it will take more of your attention
                than it deserves.” --David Allen</p>
            <p>Staying focused is one of the hardest tasks when pursuing a new hobby, goal or project. Trying to break a
                bad habit? I'm sure you've been there. Trying to get healthy, maybe shed a few pounds, or even add some?
                That requires 100% focus. A momentary lapse can spell trouble for a solid weeks worth of good choices.
                One of the fastest moving and dynamic fields in Tech.</p>
